## Introduction

This is a console-based banking application implemented in C++ that showcases object-oriented programming concepts. The application allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating a new account, logging in, transferring money, requesting a loan, viewing transactions, deleting an account, and logging out.

## Features

1. **Login System**: Users can log in securely to access their accounts.

2. **User Authentication**: Ensures secure user authentication to protect sensitive information.

3. **Create a New Account**: Users can open new accounts with personalized details.

4. **Transfer Money**: Facilitates the transfer of funds between different accounts.

5. **Request Loan**: Users have the option to request a loan based on predefined criteria.

6. **View Transactions**: Provides a history of transactions for each account.

7. **Delete Account**: Users can close their accounts if needed.

8. **Logout System**: Allows users to securely log out of their accounts.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

The application is designed using OOP principles, with the following key concepts:

- **Classes and Objects**: The `account` class represents individual user accounts, demonstrating the encapsulation of data and methods.

- **Constructor and Destructor**: Utilizes constructors for initializing objects and a destructor to handle resource deallocation.

- **Inheritance**: If applicable, you might mention any inheritance relationships in your class hierarchy.

- **Encapsulation**: Data and methods related to accounts are encapsulated within the `account` class.

- **Polymorphism**: If applicable, describe any polymorphic behavior in your application.

## Memory Management

Memory for user accounts is dynamically allocated during runtime, ensuring efficient memory usage and avoiding memory leaks. The application responsibly handles memory deallocation when accounts are deleted.
